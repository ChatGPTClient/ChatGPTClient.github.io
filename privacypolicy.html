The application has no backend servers. 
The only thing that is stored is your OpenAI API key which is used to connect to ChatGPT. THis key is stored locally ONLY on the users device. 
The application and the team behind the application to do not store this key on any of our servers, nor do we have access to this.
We collect nothing from any user.
There are only 2 things the app connects to outside of the app. 1) OpenAI API 2) Google Admob.

The first connection is obvious since the purpose of the app is to connect to OpenAI API to access ChatGPT.
The second connection is Google Ads.
